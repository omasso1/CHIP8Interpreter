# CHIP8Interpreter
CHIP-8 Interpreter

So far, it works only on Windows. It's because this project uses premake, and the only version of SDL premake I've found supports only windows.
Tested using Visual Studio only.

## First compilation
Compile SDL first, then CHIP8 Interpreter

## Running program
The program takes one argument, and that is the path to the ROM file that contains instructions for the interpreter
